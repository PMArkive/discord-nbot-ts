# [Discord] NBot
This is my own personal bot, designed to exist in a single small guild with friends, and be run entirely on free services.

It's not field-tested, which means it will break if you try to break it. No support will be provided for it.


## Requirements
- A [Discord application](https://discord.com/developers/applications), of course
- A MongoDB database (you can get one for free at [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database))
- An [OpenCage](https://opencagedata.com/) account with an API key
- A [tomorrow](https://www.tomorrow.io/) account with an API key
- An additional Discord server with admin permissions (used to store emotes)

## Building
- `npm install` inside your cloned repository
- `tsc` to build


## Running
- `node dist/bot` (you can use [Heroku](heroku.com)'s free tier)
